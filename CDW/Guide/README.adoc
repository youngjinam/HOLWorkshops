== CLOUDERA DATA WAREHOUSE WORKSHOP

== Preface

Working for an Aircraft Engine company, the company wants to increase competitive advantage in two keyways:

* {blank}
+
____
Engineer better, more fault tolerant aircraft engines.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Be proactive in predictive maintenance on engines, and faster discovery-to-fix in new engine designs.
____

This will be a three-phase plan:

* {blank}
+
____
Phase One: Understand how our current engines contribute to airline flight delays and fix for future engines.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Phase Two: Implement an ongoing reporting service to support ongoing engineering efforts to continuously improve engines based on delay data.
____
* {blank}
+
____
Phase Three: Move to real-time analysis to fix things before they break both in engines already sold, and in new engine designs.
____

To do this, we’re going to build a data warehouse & data lakehouse to create reports that engineers can use to improve our engines. The following people will get to work:

We will dive into this scenario to show Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) is used to enable the Aircraft company to gain competitive advantage - and at the same time it highlights the performance and automation capabilities that help ensure performance is maintained while controlling costs.

The Hands on Labs will take you through how to use the Cloudera Data Warehouse service to quickly explore raw data, create curated versions of the data for simple reporting and dashboarding, and then scale up usage of the curated data by exposing it to more users.

<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="300" src="cdw-media/media/image1.png">
</p>
++++
____

==== Step 4 : VERIFY IF THE TABLES ARE CREATED
____
Run the following queries in the editor to verify if the tables are created correctly.

[source,sql]
----
USE ${user_id}_airlines_raw;
SHOW TABLES;
----

Make sure that 4 tables (airlines_csv, airports_csv, flights_csv, planes_csv) are created as shown below.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="521" height="373" src="cdw-media/media/image110.png">
</p>
++++
____

==== Step 5 : QUERY CREATED TABLES USING IMPALA VIRTUAL WAREHOUSE
____
Go to the page where now you will access HUE of an Impala virtual warehouse assigned to you. Click on HUE for impala as shown in the screenshot below.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="559" height="275" src="cdw-media/media/image40.png">
</p>
++++

Make sure that you click to get Impala instead of default in the HUE browser as shown below and then click the refresh button.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="376" height="279" src="cdw-media/media/image10.png">
</p>
++++

Now, copy paste the following in the HUE editor and click on Run as shown below.

[source,sql]
----
select count(*) from ${user_id}_airlines_raw.flights_csv;
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="582" height="353" src="cdw-media/media/image18.png">
</p>
++++

Over the course of this workshop we will execute many queries which are compute heavy and this will make the virtual warehouse that is assigned to you to auto scale up and down based on the workload.

We will now run a compute heavy query and check how that affects the scaling up/down of the virtual warehouse. This autoscaling can be observed from the graph that shows each of the virtual warehouses as shown in the image below. Look specifically for the warehouse you are using.

</p>
++++


==== Step 1 : CREATE and LOAD PLANES TABLE
____
* {blank}
+

From the data that is stored in the RAW layer(CSV format) we will now create a table using that data


Create planes table in Hive table format and stored its data in parquet file format.

[source,sql]
----
drop table if exists ${user_id}_airlines.planes;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.planes (
  tailnum STRING, owner_type STRING, 
  manufacturer STRING, issue_date STRING, 
  model STRING, status STRING, aircraft_type STRING, 
  engine_type STRING, year INT
) STORED AS PARQUET TBLPROPERTIES ('external.table.purge' = 'true');
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="584" height="281" src="cdw-media/media/image132.png">
</p>
++++

* {blank}
+

Load planes table with data from the Raw layer table planes_csv.


[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO ${user_id}_airlines.planes 
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines_raw.planes_csv;
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="270" src="cdw-media/media/image90.png">
</p>
++++


* {blank}
+

Once the data is loaded successfully, run the below query to verify if the table now contains data.



[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM ${user_id}_airlines.planes LIMIT 100;
----
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="360" src="cdw-media/media/image20.png">
</p>
++++
____
==== Step 2 : DESCRIBE CREATED TABLE
____
* {blank}
+
Execute the following command.


[source,sql]
----
DESCRIBE FORMATTED ${user_id}_airlines.planes;
----

In the output look for the following.


* {blank}
+

*Location:* s3a://handsonworkshop/my-data/warehouse/tablespace/external/hive/immiapac00_airlines.db/planes

* {blank}
+

*Table Type:* EXTERNAL_TABLE

* {blank}
+

*SerDe Library:* org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe

==== Step 3 : CREATE AND LOAD AIRLINES TABLE
____
Create airlines table in Hive table format and orc file format. This table should also be fully ACID capable. We will use Create Table As Select (CTAS). Since, airlines table can change we need the ability to Insert/Update/Delete records.

Run the following query to create the table

[source,sql]
----
drop table if exists ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_orc;

CREATE TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_orc STORED AS ORC AS 
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines_raw.airlines_csv;
----
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="536" height="180" src="cdw-media/media/image13.png">
</p>
++++

Run the following query to check data in the airlines_orc table and it should return only 1 row for code 'UA'.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_orc 
WHERE 
  code IN ("UA", "XX", "PAW");
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="400" height="251" src="cdw-media/media/image73.png">
</p>
++++
____
==== Step 4 : CHECK ACID CAPABILITIES
____
* {blank}
+

*Insert New record*

We shall now add a new record to the airlines_orc table to see some Hive ACID capabilities.


[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_orc VALUES("PAW","Paradise Air");
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="229" src="cdw-media/media/image23.png">
</p>
++++

* {blank}
+

*Update Existing Record*

Let’s update an existing record to change the description of United Airlines to Adrenaline Airlines to see more of the ACID capablities provided by Hive ACID. Run the following SQL.


[source,sql]
----
drop table if exists ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_dim_updates;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_dim_updates(code string, description string) tblproperties("external.table.purge"="true");

INSERT INTO ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_dim_updates VALUES("UA","Adrenaline Airlines");

INSERT INTO ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_dim_updates VALUES("XX","Get Out of My Airway!");

-- Merge inserted records into Airlines_orc table

MERGE INTO ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_orc USING (SELECT * FROM ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_dim_updates) AS s
ON s.code = airlines_orc.code
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET description = s.description
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (s.code,s.description);
----

Run the following query to return the following result - codes XX and PAW were inserted rows, and code UA which had its description value changed from United Air Lines Inc. to Adrenaline Airlines.


[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines.airlines_orc 
WHERE 
  code IN ("UA", "XX", "PAW");
----

=== MIGRATE HIVE TO ICEBERG TABLE

If you already have created a Data Warehouse using the Hive Table Format but would like to take advantage of the features offered in the Iceberg Table Format, you have 2 options.

* {blank}
+
____
Utilize the table Migration feature
____
* {blank}
+
____
Use Create Table as Select (CTAS)
____

==== Utilize Table Migration Feature

Run the following SQL and note what happens next.

[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.planes

SET TBLPROPERTIES ('storage_handler'='org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler');

DESCRIBE FORMATTED ${user_id}_airlines.planes;
----


The following changes occured:

* {blank}
+
____
This migration to Iceberg happened in-place & there was no re-writing of data that occurred as part of this process. It retained the File Format of parquet for the Iceberg table as well. There was a Metadata file that is created, which you can see when you run the DESCRIBE FORMATTED.
____

* {blank}
+
____
In the output look for the following fields - look for the following (see image with highlighted fields) key values:
____

[width="100%",cols="24%,76%",]
|===
|*Location* |Data is stored in cloud storage and in this case AWS S3 in the same location as the Hive Table Format.
|*Table Type* |Indicates that it is an EXTERNAL TABLE.
|*MIGRATED_TO_ICEBERG* |Indicates that the table has migrated to ICEBERG.[TRUE]
|*table_type* |Indicates ICEBERG table format.
|*metadata_location* |Indicates the location of metadata which is path to cloud storage.
|*storage_handler* |org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergStorageHandler.
|*SerDe Library* |org.apache.iceberg.mr.hive.HiveIcebergSerDe.
|===

==== Use Create table as Select(CTAS)
____
Run the following SQL to create airports table using CTAS. Notice the syntax to create an Iceberg Table within Hive is “*_Stored by Iceberg_*”.

[source,sql]
----
drop table if exists ${user_id}_airlines.airports;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.airports
STORED BY ICEBERG AS
SELECT * FROM ${user_id}_airlines_raw.airports_csv;

DESCRIBE FORMATTED ${user_id}_airlines.airports;
----


Look for: Table Type, Location (location of where table data is stored), SerDe Library, and in Table Parameters look for properties storage_handler, metadata_location, and table_type.
____
=== CREATE ICEBERG TABLES

In this step we will create a partitioned table, in Iceberg Table Format, stored in Parquet File Format. Other than that we could specify other file formats that are supported for Iceberg which are: ORC and Avro.

[source,sql]
----
drop table if exists ${user_id}_airlines.flights;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.flights (
month int, dayofmonth int,
dayofweek int, deptime int, crsdeptime int, arrtime int,
crsarrtime int, uniquecarrier string, flightnum int, tailnum string,
actualelapsedtime int, crselapsedtime int, airtime int, arrdelay int,
depdelay int, origin string, dest string, distance int, taxiin int,
taxiout int, cancelled int, cancellationcode string, diverted string,
carrierdelay int, weatherdelay int, nasdelay int, securitydelay int,
lateaircraftdelay int
)
PARTITIONED BY (year int)
STORED BY ICEBERG
STORED AS PARQUET
tblproperties ('format-version'='2');

SHOW CREATE TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.flights;
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="321" src="cdw-media/media/image82.png">
</p>
++++

The SHOW CREATE TABLE command is the unformatted version of DESCRIBE FORMATTED command. Pay attention to the PARTITIONED BY SPEC, where we have partitioned the flights table using the *year* column.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="321" src="cdw-media/media/image103.png">
</p>
++++
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="250" src="cdw-media/media/image62.png">
</p>
++++



We insert data into this table it will write data together within the same partition (ie. all 2006 data is written to the same location, all 2005 data is written to the same location, etc.). This command will take some time to run.

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO ${user_id}_airlines.flights
SELECT * FROM ${user_id}_airlines_raw.flights_csv
WHERE year <= 2006;
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="202" src="cdw-media/media/image60.png">
</p>
++++


Run the following SQL and notice that each of the years have a range of data within a few million flights (each record in the flights table counts as a flight).

[source,sql]
----
SELECT year, count(*)
FROM ${user_id}_airlines.flights
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year desc;
----
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="408" src="cdw-media/media/image55.png">
</p>
++++


Now, make sure that the following 5 tables are created up until this point as shown in the screenshot below.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="302" height="284" src="cdw-media/media/image83.png">
</p>
++++


As a final step here let’s run the same analytic query we ran against the Raw layer now in our Data Lakehouse DW, to see what happens with performance. From the cloudera console select the IMPALA virtual warehouse assigned to you

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="750" height="400" src="cdw-media/media/image40.png">
</p>
++++


Make sure that 'Unified Analytics' is NOT selected.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="527" height="271" src="cdw-media/media/image120.png">
</p>
++++

Instead click on the Editor option in the left top corner and select Impala editor.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="479" height="316" src="cdw-media/media/image22.png">
</p>
++++
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="294" src="cdw-media/media/image30.png">
</p>
++++

Now run the following query again.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT model,
       engine_type
FROM   ${user_id}_airlines.planes
WHERE  planes.tailnum IN
       (
              SELECT tailnum
              FROM   (
                              SELECT   tailnum,
                                       count(*),
                                       avg(depdelay) AS avg_delay,
                                       max(depdelay),
                                       avg(taxiout),
                                       avg(cancelled),
                                       avg(weatherdelay),
                                       max(weatherdelay),
                                       avg(nasdelay),
                                       max(nasdelay),
                                       avg(securitydelay),
                                       max(securitydelay),
                                       avg(lateaircraftdelay),
                                       max(lateaircraftdelay),
                                       avg(airtime),
                                       avg(actualelapsedtime),
                                       avg(distance)
                              FROM     ${user_id}_airlines.flights
                              WHERE    tailnum IN ('N194JB',
                                                   'N906S',
                                                   'N575ML',
                                                   'N852NW',
                                                   'N000AA')
                              GROUP BY tailnum) AS delays);
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="464" src="cdw-media/media/image27.png">
</p>
++++

The Data Lakehouse DW query performs significantly better than the same query running against the CSV data.

== LAB 4 - PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION AND TABLE MAINTENANCE

In this Step we will look at some of the performance optimization and table maintenance tasks that can be performed to ensure the best possible TCO, while ensuring the best performance.

=== Iceberg in-place Partition Evolution[Performance Optimization]

==== Step 1 : Open HUE for the CDW Hive Virtual Warehouse
____
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="750" height="400" src="cdw-media/media/image80.png">
</p>
++++
____
==== Step 2 : Execute Query
____
One of the key features for Iceberg tables is the ability to evolve the partition that is being used over time.

[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE 
  ${user_id}_airlines.flights 
SET 
  PARTITION spec (year, month);
----
[source,sql]
----
SHOW CREATE TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.flights;
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="265" src="cdw-media/media/image24.png">
</p>
++++

Check for the following where now the partition is by year, month.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="447" height="255" src="cdw-media/media/image36.png">
</p>
++++
____
==== Step 3 : Check for optimizations

* {blank}
+
____
Load new data into the flights table using the NEW partition definition. This query will take a while to run


[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO ${user_id}_airlines.flights 
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines_raw.flights_csv 
WHERE 
  year = 2007;
----
____

* {blank}
+
____
Go to *IMPALA* virtual warehouse and switch the Editor to use IMPALA instead of UNIFIED ANALYTICS

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="206" src="cdw-media/media/image86.png">
</p>
++++


++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="511" height="216" src="cdw-media/media/image93.png">
</p>
++++
____

* {blank}
+
____
Copy/paste the following in the HUE Editor, but *DO NOT* execute the query.


[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
  year, 
  month, 
  count(*) 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines.flights 
WHERE 
  year = 2006 
  AND month = 12 
GROUP BY 
  year, 
  month 
ORDER BY 
  year desc, 
  month asc;
----


Run Explain Plan against the above analytic queries to see how the new partition helps.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="561" height="187" src="cdw-media/media/image50.png">
</p>
++++
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="394" height="526" src="cdw-media/media/image128.png">
</p>
++++
____
* {blank}
+

Copy/paste the following in the HUE Editor, but DO NOT execute the query but check the EXPLAIN PLAN.
____

[source,sql]
----
SELECT 
  year, 
  month, 
  count(*) 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines.flights 
WHERE 
  year = 2007 
  AND month = 12 
GROUP BY 
  year, 
  month 
ORDER BY 
  year desc, 
  month asc;
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="467" height="592" src="cdw-media/media/image65.png">
</p>
++++

In the output notice the amount of data that needs to be scanned for this query, about 11 MB, is significantly less than that of the first, 138 MB. This shows an important capability of Iceberg, Partition Pruning. Meaning that much less data is scanned for this query and only the selected month of data needs to be processed.
____

=== Iceberg Snapshots [Table Maintenance]

In the previous steps we have loaded data into the flights iceberg table. We will insert more data into it. Each time we add (update or delete) data a snapshot is captured. The snapshot is important for eventual consistency & to allow multiple read/writes concurrently (from various engines or same engine).

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO ${user_id}_airlines.flights 
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines_raw.flights_csv 
WHERE 
  year >= 2008;
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="489" src="cdw-media/media/image127.png">
</p>
++++


To see snapshots, execute the following SQL.

[source,sql]
----
DESCRIBE HISTORY ${user_id}_airlines.flights;
----

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="354" src="cdw-media/media/image108.png">
</p>
++++


In the output there should be 3 Snapshots, described below. Note that we have been reading/writing data from/to the Iceberg table from both Hive & Impala. It is an important aspect of Iceberg Tables that they support multi-function analytics - ie. many engines can work with Iceberg tables (Cloudera Data Warehouse [Hive & Impala], Cloudera Data Engineering [Spark], Cloudera Machine Learning [Spark], Cloudera DataFlow [NiFi], and DataHub Clusters).

Get the details of the snapshots and store it in a notepad.

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="113" src="cdw-media/media/image8.png">
</p>
++++
++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="274" height="213" src="cdw-media/media/image45.png">
</p>
++++

=== Iceberg Time Travel [Table Maintenance]

* {blank}
+
____
Copy/paste the following data into the Impala Editor, but DO NOT execute.

[source,sql]
----
-- SELECT DATA USING TIMESTAMP FOR SNAPSHOT

SELECT 
  year, 
  count(*) 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines.flights FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '${create_ts}' 
GROUP BY 
  year 
ORDER BY 
  year desc;

-- SELECT DATA USING TIMESTAMP FOR SNAPSHOT

SELECT 
  year, 
  count(*) 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines.flights FOR SYSTEM_VERSION AS OF ${snapshot_id} 
GROUP BY 
  year 
ORDER BY 
  year desc;
----

After pasting the query you will see the following two options for *create_ts* and *snapshot_id*

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="194" src="cdw-media/media/image78.png">
</p>
++++
____

* {blank}
+
____
From the notepad just copy the first value of the timestamp. It could be the date or the timestamp. Paste it in the create_ts box. Then execute the higlighted query only (1st query).

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="349" src="cdw-media/media/image68.png">
</p>
++++
____

* {blank}
+
____
From the notepad just copy the second value of the snapshot id. Paste it in the snapshot_id box. Then execute the highlighted query only (2nd query).
____

=== Iceberg Rollback [Table Maintenance] - DO NOT RUN

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="624" height="366" src="cdw-media/media/image98.png">
</p>
++++
Sometimes data can be loaded incorrectly, due to many common issues - missing fields, only part of the data being loaded, bad data, etc.

In situations like this data would need to be removed, corrected, and reloaded. Iceberg can help with the Rollback command to remove the “unwanted” data.

This leverages Snapshot IDs to perform this action by using a simple ALTER TABLE command as follows. We will NOT RUN this command in this lab.

[source,sql]
----
-- ALTER TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.flights EXECUTE ROLLBACK(${snapshot_id});
----


=== Iceberg Rollback [Table Maintenance] - DO NOT RUN

As time passes it might make sense to expire old Snapshots, instead of the Snapshot ID you use the Timestamp to expire old Snapshots. You can do this manually by running a simple ALTER TABLE command as follows. We will NOT RUN this command in this lab.

-- Expire Snapshots up to the specified timestamp

-- BE CAREFUL: Once you run this you will not be able to Time Travel for any Snapshots that you Expire ALTER TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.flights

[source,sql]
----
-- ALTER TABLE ${user_id}_airlines_maint.flights EXECUTE expire_snapshots('${create_ts}');
----


=== Materialized Views [Performance Optimization]

This can be used for both Iceberg tables and Hive tables.

Go to the HUE UI of the HIVE virtual warehouse assigned to you

Copy/paste the following, make sure to highlight the entire block, and execute the following.
____

[source,sql]
----
SET hive.query.results.cache.enabled = false;

drop 
  table if exists ${user_id}_airlines.airlines;

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ${user_id}_airlines.airlines (code string, description string) STORED BY ICEBERG STORED AS ORC TBLPROPERTIES ('format-version' = '2');

  sum(flights.cancelled) AS cancelled 
FROM 
  ${user_id}_airlines.flights flights, 
  ${user_id}_airlines.airlines airlines 
WHERE

[IMPORTANT]
Hive has built in performance improvements, such as a *Query Cache* that stores results of queries run so that similar queries don’t have to retrieve data, they can just get the results from the cache. In this step we are turning that off using the SET statement, this will ensure when we look at the query plan, we will not retrieve the data from the cache.

Administrators would also be able to perform other monitoring and maintenance tasks for what is running (or has been run). Monitoring and maintenance tasks could include cancel (kill) queries, see what is running, analyze whether queries that have been executed are optimized, etc.

____
This is where you can analyze queries at a deep level. For this lab let’s take a look at the Explain details, by clicking on the *Visual Explain* tab. It might take a while to appear, please click on refresh. This plan shows that this query needs to Read flights (86M rows) and airlines (1.5K rows) with hash join, group, and sort. This is a lot of data processing and if we run this query constantly it would be good to reduce the time this query takes to execute.

Let’s look at the Query Plan that was used to execute this query. On the left menu select Jobs. On the Jobs Browser - select the Queries tab to the right of the Job browser header. Hover over & click on the Query just executed (should be the first row). Click on the *Visual Explain* tab. 

++++
<p align="center">
  <img width="478" height="231" src="cdw-media/media/image99.png">
